# Welcome to Peeper.js - webcam eye tracking
### An open-source Javascript library to enable the control of your mouse movements, through your computer's webcam, using only your eyes gaze.
<br>


## Project Description
An open-source eye tracking library that uses your eyes gaze to control the interface of your computer. 
<br>

### What problem are we trying to solve?
We are trying to create an eye tracking system that uses an ordinary webcam to provide accessibility for anyone to use a PC. Our target audience are people who have mobile impairements, specifically, they want to operate a computer but can't use the mouse.
<br>

### What were the challenges we faced?
The challenges were implementing the eye tracking/mapping parts of the system. This is a challenging problem to solve as there are many way that you could do this. Using the OpenCV modules to apply filters that allow a webcam to track the pupils of the eye was an additional challenge. Solving this required the whole team to tackle this and yielded a fairly decent solution.
<br>

### What are some of the features you hope to implement in the future?
Features that we wish to implement in the future are...
- the ability to apply different filters to track your eye better
- the ability to have calibration work faster and more smoothly
- the ability to navigate your computer with less lag and better accuracy
